Occu-Sense
============
Occu-Sense is an occupancy sensor which allows automation of pre-existing lighting and HVAC systems. The system uses a PIR motion sensor to detect initial presence, which activates a camera for active occupancy tracking. Occupancy sensing works in conjuction with data from temperature and light intensity sensors to precisely regulate room temperature and light levels. The system runs on a Raspberry Pi which also tracks room usage and energy consumption, which can be easily accessed through a website.
